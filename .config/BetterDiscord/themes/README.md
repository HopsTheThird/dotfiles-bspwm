This is not my theme!!

It is the "Basic Background" theme ([found here](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/BasicBackground)) by [DevilBro](https://betterdiscord.app/developer/DevilBro) which I replaced the default background with one found in this repo.

I don't take any credit for his work, but I wanted to include it in my repo because it's a big part of the setup, and my version includes a custom background.
